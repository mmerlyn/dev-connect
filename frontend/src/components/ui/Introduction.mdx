# DevConnect UI Component Library

Welcome to the **DevConnect UI Component Library** -- a collection of reusable, accessible, and composable React components built with Tailwind CSS. These components form the foundation of the DevConnect application interface.

## Getting Started

All components live under `src/components/ui/` and follow a consistent API pattern. Each component:

- Is fully typed with TypeScript
- Supports Tailwind CSS class overrides via the `className` prop
- Uses the `cn()` utility from `lib/utils` for merging class names

Import any component directly:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/Button";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/Input";
```

## Components

The library includes the following **16 components**:

| Component       | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Button**      | Primary action element with variants, sizes, and loading state |
| **Input**       | Text input field with label, error message, and icon support |
| **TextArea**    | Multi-line text input with auto-resize and character count   |
| **Avatar**      | User profile image with fallback initials and status indicator |
| **Badge**       | Small label for status, tags, or counts                      |
| **Modal**       | Dialog overlay with focus trapping and keyboard dismissal    |
| **Card**        | Contained surface for grouping related content               |
| **Dropdown**    | Menu with selectable options, triggered by a button          |
| **Tabs**        | Tabbed navigation for switching between content panels       |
| **Tooltip**     | Contextual popup triggered on hover or focus                 |
| **Skeleton**    | Placeholder loading animation for content                    |
| **Toast**       | Temporary notification banner with auto-dismiss              |
| **Spinner**     | Animated loading indicator with configurable size            |
| **EmptyState**  | Placeholder view for empty lists or zero-result screens      |
| **SearchInput** | Search-specific input with icon, clear button, and debounce  |
| **Toggle**      | Binary on/off switch for toggling settings                   |

## Design Principles

- **Composability** -- Components are small, focused, and can be combined to build complex interfaces.
- **Consistency** -- Shared design tokens (colors, spacing, radii) come from the Tailwind theme defined in `index.css`.
- **Accessibility** -- Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and focus management are built in where applicable.
- **Flexibility** -- Every component accepts a `className` prop so consumers can extend or override styles without friction.
